// data/npcs_extra.js — the rest of the working world: the people who are not
// quest-givers and the animals that are not scenery.
//
// PURE DATA. Nothing is imported, nothing mutates. `npcs.js` concatenates
// EXTRA_CAST onto CAST and deep freezes the result, exactly as it already does
// with SOUTH_CAST — so `npcsOnMap()` sees these too, and the region packs'
// `reservedFor(mapId)` will not paint a crate on top of any of them.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Phandalin had fifteen people in it and five of them
// ran shops. The Trade Way had one. A city district of Baldur's Gate had four.
// The world was a set of quest counters with walking space between them. These
// are the labourers, fisherfolk, drovers, scribes, festhall staff, beggars and
// livestock that make a place look inhabited before anybody says a word to you.
//
// VOICES, NOT TREES. Every entry carries a `greeting` array. ui/dialogue.js
// `_fallbackTree()` reads it and picks a line seeded on the npc id and the
// hour, so a treeless townsperson says something of their own, and says
// something different if you come back later. Before that, every NPC without
// an authored tree recited one identical sentence about goblins.
//
// SETTING: 1496 DR. Every personal name below is drawn from the ethnic naming
// tables in docs/SETTING.md §5 — Chondathan, Illuskan, Damaran, Calishite,
// Turami, Rashemi, dwarf, halfling, orc and tiefling. Nothing is coined.
