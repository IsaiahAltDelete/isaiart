// Contract is dialogue.js's, unchanged:

//   Node   = { text, speaker, goto?, do?, once?, rumor?, cancelable?, choices? }
//   Choice = { text, goto, success?, failure?, if?, do?, once?, cancel? }
//
// THE ONE STRUCTURAL RULE, and it is the rule that broke forty-four trees the
// last time it was ignored: EVERY node either carries authored `choices` or
// carries a `goto`. A node with neither ends the conversation, which is correct
// only for a deliberate farewell node — every `bye`/`out` node below is one, and
// nothing else in this file is. Never lean on the engine-appended "Draw your
// weapon." option to keep a node alive: `_advancePage` counts authored choices
// only, so an engine-added line cannot stop a node falling through.

It is her PRIVACY. She died grieving; the least a landlord owes her is not to make the grief a menu item.\\p But tonight, one time, the true sentence: she is the oldest guest in Baldur's Gate, she pays in the only coin that outlasts cities, and you have just settled her bill with whatever was waiting down there for her song to end.
